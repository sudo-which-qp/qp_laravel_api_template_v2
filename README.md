## QP Laravel API Template

<p>So this is me trying to make a laravel template, if you have any issues please let me know.</p>

<p>This is mostly focused on building API's if you make use of laravel for building livewire and adding React or Vue to your laravel project, I don't think this is for you, but you can modify the code base to suit you and what you want.</p>

<p>But I built a CLI in Go to help me clone the project and make it for 
any project I want. The CLI will help you get everything set, instead of cloning the project each time from GitHub.</p>

<p> Here is the repo to the CLI <a href='https://github.com/sudo-which-qp/qp_laravel_cli.git'><QP></QP></a></p>
